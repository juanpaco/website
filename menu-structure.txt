Philosophy
  - [quote about angels and marble]
  - introductory text
  - principled
  - use no mechanism that occludes clean test design and clean test code
  - don't put into the framework for things the OS already does
    - refer to recipes
  - comparison to other test frameworks
    - my_tests_arent_randomized_and_dude_is_a_douche
  - include every feature that great tests need, and no feature that only bad tests need
  - note on human cognition, readability vs scanability
  Best Practices
    - introduce explaining variable
    - no "when", "should", etc. it's always implied. use it as guardrails for beginners, then remove it later. it's an artifice used as a teaching device.
