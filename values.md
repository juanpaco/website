# Values

## TestBench Values Simplicity

Above all, TestBench values simplicity

- clean code (explaining variable)
  - the test code itself is self-explanatory, rather than relying on an elaborate API to achieve it
- relies on principles
- literate code is the responsibility of the programmer, not the tool
- you have to design, and therefore you must pursue an understanding of design, design principles, design qualities, and design patterns
- use the file system
- usability; create a TOC
- no monkey patching
- clarity; clarify
- don't confuse simplicity for things you already understand. if you're not a Ruby coder, the problem isn't that TB isn't simple, but that you don't have a grasp of Ruby and software design fundamentals

## Who It's For

- advanced
- simplicity is advanced
- no training wheels
- it's for people comfortable with Ruby and with programming



<!--
## Simple

The TestBench API is just four methods: assert, refute, context, and test. There's nothing hidden. There's no guessing, no monkey-patching, no configuration, and no complexity. It's just programming.

## Principled

TestBench encourages clean test design that reflect fundamental principles. It has no superfluous syntax leading to cumbersome tests. It has no opinions, but makes no apologies.

## It's Just Ruby

Tests in TestBench are just Ruby scripts. They execute from top to bottom with no special runner and no special way to declare variables. If you know Ruby, you know TestBench.
