description: 'Design-oriented test framework for Ruby'
features:
- title: Simple
  details: Test files are just scripts. No more having to imagine how the test framework executes the test code behind the scenes!
- title: Intuitive
  details: Context specification DSL precisely honed so that it’s fully comprehensive, yet also happens to be trivial to learn.
- title: Powerful
  details: Define reusable test classes (“Fixtures”) that leverage the TestBench DSL you already know to curb redundancy across test files.

TestBench is a no-nonsense testing framework for Ruby aiming to offer precisely what is needed to test well-designed code effectively and easily. In stark contrast to most other testing frameworks, test files are written using a procedural API, not a declarative one, which brings a score of substantial benefits in exchange for largely immaterial drawbacks. As a result, TestBench can be learned very quickly. However, users should not expect it to offer many palliative features that ease the difficulties inherent to working with vast, long-running, or brittle test suites. With that in mind, even those situations can usually be addressed with a little improvising.
