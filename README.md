features:
- title: Simple
  details: The core context specification DSL contains just a few methods, like `context`, `test`, `assert`, and `refute`.
- title: Intuitive
  details: TestBench scripts behave just like any other ruby script. No more having to imagine how the test framework executes the test code behind the scenes!
- title: Powerful
  details: Define reusable test classes (“Fixtures”) that leverage the TestBench DSL you already know to curb redundancy across test files.

TestBench is a no-nonsense testing framework for Ruby aiming to offer precisely what is needed to test well-designed code effectively and easily. In stark contrast to most other testing frameworks, test files are written using a procedural API, not a declarative one, which brings a score of substantial benefits in exchange for largely immaterial drawbacks.
